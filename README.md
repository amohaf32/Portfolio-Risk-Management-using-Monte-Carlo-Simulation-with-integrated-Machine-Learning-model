# Portfolio Risk Management using Monte Carlo Simulation

## What is this project ?

This project is essentially a tool where the tool can simulate a range of possibilities for future portfolio return based on the availbale historic data, therefore heling give an estimate of the potential losses and gains that are associated with the respective portfolio and by mnaking use of the Machine Learning model, we can adjust the assumption like the risk factors or even identify trends that is found in the historic data.  

## To whom will this tool be useful ? 

This tool is essentially focused for use for the skilled workforce of the finance industry and to self-traders who are looking to make new investments or minimize loss on already existing portfolios. But this tool can also be used by begginers who are new to field of stock market and investent.  They can use this tool to have a look at the prediction and see what effect the economic market will have for the investement that they willing to take part in.

## How can users get started on this tool ?

1. User will select there preffered asset from the dropdown list of all the companies that  they want to investe in or have already invested in. 
2. After that the user will then select the time period for there investement. The simulation period starts from 1 month (21 days) to 1 year (252 days). 
3. The next is to enter the portfolio weight which should sum up to 1. (This weight is fixed and cannot exceed this weight). 
4. If you dont know the weight of your invested portfolio of each asset then you may go to the Investement Calculator, where you enter your amount that you have invested in the respective asset and then click calculate weight button you will see your porfolio weight auto-generated with respective to amount you have entered. 
5. Once you have entered your portfolio weight or once you have entered the your amount and clicked calculate weigths button you shoould be able click on Run simulation button and see the results you want.
