What is this project ?

This project is essentially a tool where the tool can simulate a range of possibilities for future portfolio return based on the availbale historic data, therefore heling give an estimate of the potential losses and gains that are associated with the respective portfolio and by mnaking use of the Machine Learning model, we can adjust the assumption like the risk factors or even identify trends that is found in the historic data.  

To whom will this tool be useful ? 

This tool is essentially focused for use for the skilled workforce of the finance industry and to self-traders who are looking to make new investments or minimize loss on already existing portfolios.
